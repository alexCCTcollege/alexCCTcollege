### Hi there 👋

my name is Alex, nice to meet you!

🌱 I'm currently pursuing a MSc in Data analytics in Dublin

I'm looking for a nice IT company where I can deploy models and learn new stuff

Welcome to my github, here is where I save all of my projects:

on https://github.com/alexCCTcollege/Housing-Ireland I did some sentiment analysis (TextBlob) and time serie forcasting (XGBoost) on Ireland housing, I also got a chance to explore a bit with interactive dashboards using plotly.
this was my final papaer at NCI during my Diploma in Data analytics https://github.com/alexCCTcollege/Music-classification I used multiple classification models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) for classifying genre of a song.
here https://github.com/alexCCTcollege/Churn-prediction-classification I used multiple models to predicted if an employee is about to leave a company or not aka Churn prediction
